### Description

This repository contains weekly solutions to python tasks set between January and March for the course Programming and Scripting. Weekly tasks are found on the course homepage or in the link [here](https://learnonline.gmit.ie/course/view.php?id=5057). 

### Course Summary

- **Setting up the enviroment**
  - Create a Repository on Github
  - Clone repository to desktop
  - Add your scripts
  - Commit & Push
  - Create a pull request to merge 
 
- **Statements**
   - Using VScode and running program
   - Outing results
   - Input values (int, float,string)
   - Comments
    
- **State (Variables)**
   - How data is stored in a computer
   - Variable types 
   - Using numeric functions (rounding decimal values to whole numbers, absolute value i.e negative to positive, removing the decimal places i.e floor)
   - String functions (determining the length of a string, changing characters from uppercase to lower)

- **Controlling the Flow (If/While)**
   - If statements (*if/ else / end* loop - If the condition is satisifed then the loop will end and excuting the If block code *otherwise* if the condition is false, the else block code is executed)
   - While statements (used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met)
    
- **Data structures**
   - List/Tuple/Dictionary (*ref: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/list*)

 - **Functions**
   - Functions (A block of code can be assigned to a function, information can be passed into a function. The function won't output information unless called upon. Similar to *with table1 as code*)
   - Modules (This is where a block of code from a py file can be used in another py file *ref:https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_modules.asp *)

 - **Files**
   - Reading/Open (importing csv files, using open command including modes() i.e 'r' = read, 'r+' = read&write, 'w' = write)

 - **Plotting data**
   - Numpy (Quicker way of formatting then list, allowing an array, matrix or random values. Range(StartPoint,EndPoint)...Randint(StartPoint,EndPoint,NumberofSteps) )
   - Matplotlib (Combined with Numpy this allows use to assign x,y coorindates and plot outcomes; scatter, plot, pie, bar and hist)
